## Backstory

I've played lacrosse for 5 years now, and will continue playing at ***WashU***. When I was a Sophomore in High School, my friend and I were looking for a way to play fantasy lacrosse - something similar to fantasy football where you draft a team and compete. However, when we looked around, we found nothing to satisfy our desires.
<br />
Thus, using our unnurtured skills in marketing and programming, we set out to build it ourselves. I programmed the whole think in Flask, not taking much care with its architecture or design choices. The first version was buggy, but usuable. All summer, I found myself responding to Instagram DMs which chronicled the numerous issues with our site. It was imperfect, but it worked.
<br />
After our first season, things looked good. We had accrued about 2000 users - many of which seemed to truly enjoy our site. It connected them with their friends during a tough summer (summer 2020) and was recieved well by the community. 
<br />
At the end of the first season, my friend and business partner understandably decided that it was too much work to continue - we were working 60 hour weeks during the summer as 16 year-olds after all. Instead of recruiting new team members to help me market, grow, and update the website, I decided to go at it alone. I began from scratch rebuilding the website in ***React with a Python and Node microservice backend***. 
<br />
The backend worked pretty well at first. It had a nice testing suite and I really enjoyed working on segmented code. However, from the start, the frontend was simply a mess. It was pretty much my first time working with React, and I didn't quite understand how to use state properly. I had only a few months to design and build the website, and I had spent much of the first few months figuring out how to use React properly. I would create a whole section of the site just to have to rewrite it. At one point, I even unnecessarily introduced sockets to create real-time drafting.
<br />
Simply put, the technical debt was overwhelming. I would write
