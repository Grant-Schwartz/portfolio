## Backstory

I've played lacrosse for 5 years now, and will continue playing at ***WashU***. When I was a Sophomore in High School, my friend and I were looking for a way to play fantasy lacrosse - something similar to fantasy football where you draft a team and compete. However, when we looked around, we found nothing to satisfy our desires.
<br />
Thus, using our unnurtured skills in marketing and programming, we set out to build it ourselves. I programmed the whole thing in Flask, not taking much care with its architecture or design choices. The first version was buggy, but usuable. All summer, I found myself responding to Instagram DMs which chronicled the numerous issues with our site. It was imperfect, but it worked.
<br />
After our first season, things looked good. We had accrued about 2000 users - many of which seemed to truly enjoy our site. It connected them with their friends during a tough summer (summer 2020) and was recieved well by the community. 
<br />
At the end of the first season, my friend and business partner understandably decided that it was too much work to continue - we were working 60 hour weeks during the summer as 16 year-olds after all. Instead of recruiting new team members to help me market, grow, and update the website, I decided to go at it alone. I began from scratch rebuilding the website in ***React with a Python and Node microservice backend***. 
<br />
The backend worked pretty well at first. It had a nice testing suite and I really enjoyed working on segmented code. However, from the start, the frontend was simply a mess. It was pretty much my first time working with React, and I didn't quite understand how to use state properly. I had only a few months to design and build the website, and I had spent much of the first few months figuring out how to use React properly. I would create a whole section of the site just to have to rewrite it. At one point, I even unnecessarily introduced sockets to create real-time drafting.
<br />
Simply put, the technical debt was overwhelming. I would write hundreds of lineds of code - build out an entire feature - for it to be useless or extremely buggy. I felt like a small sailboat on a turbulent sea failing to find its course as the season steadily approached.
<br />
The one thing I feel I mostly right was cultivating new and interesting partnerships. I did a deal with a popular retired proffesional lacrosse player and his podcast. I built a wholly different product for them - college daily fantasy. But once again, I took it on without a real understanding of the project timeline and its challenges. I was blinded by a shiny golden object. The one thing it did do is give the site exposure. We grew from 2500 users to about 7000 in the course of a few months. But, eventually, I was unable to keep up with the side project and it fell the wayside. As a result, our partnership crumbled.
<br />
As you can see. ***I royally f#cked up***.

## Some Lessons Learned The Hard Way
<br/>
### Team
I've always heard, **"If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together"**. I think my experience with Flow Fantasy solidified this in my head. It's no fun to work alone, and obviously a much heavier burden. I think I was acting with a little hubris when I thought I could do it all alone, and I think my reluctance to recruit a team resulted in the platform's ultime demise.
<br />
### KISS
My deeply Italian football o-line coach used to always says this.
It stands for **Keep It Simple Stupid**. I think this utilizing this crude acroynym could have helped a lot in building Flow Fantasy. I got so caught up in the tech stack and complex design that I failed to create a usuable product the second time around. I've learned to minimize technical debt and not get blinded by a shiny object.
<br />
### First Principles
Carl Sagan talked a lot about **first principles**: building understanding from foundational facts and not getting caught up in assumptions. I think solving from first principles is equally important in product design as it is in nuclear physics. In building Flow Fantasy, I failed to solve for the first principles. Fantasy sports is at its core a social experience built upon a statistical foundation. If I had understood this simple fact, I would have avoided many UI/UX and business blunders. Now, in building a prouct, I start from a list of first principles and build from the bottom up - making fewer assumptions.
<br />
### Under Sell & Over Deliver
I think this is a good philosophy for life. If you always under sell and over deliver, no one will ever be upset. The reverse, on the contrary, as with Flow Fantasy, can create a huge pain in the ass. Users are simply pissed off. In building the second version of Flow Fantasy, I promised a new and improved platform with more features. The second platform certainly had more features, but none of the work well.
<br />
It's better to have one feature that works really well than to have 10 features that work 10% of the time.
<br />
## Closing
I carry a large burden for the mistakes I've made, the unkept promises, and community I let down. However, I've learned a lot. 
<br />
### You can bet your ass I'm not going to make those mistakes again.
