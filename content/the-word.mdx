For the last 6 months, I have been building the word. the word is a weekly text message sent to students at WashU with personalized reccomendations for social, club, and academic events happening on campus. There is so much happening on college campuses these days, and it can be extremely overwhelming for already busy college students. Thus, my co-founder and I have set out to ease some of this pain and make it easier to have fun, rewarding experiences at college.

<br />I have programmed the whole thing, taking care to build it for **college
students**.
