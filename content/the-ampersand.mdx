If you look at my logo, you'll notice I use an ampersand as my logo mark. It may seem a little strange - almost too simple. But, I think represents an important part of my nature - it is the pure essence of "and".
<br/>
My best creations have arrived at the intersection of two distinct and seemingly disparate things. My biggest success (and [failure](/posts/flow-fantasy)), Flow Fantasy, was the combination of 2 of my loves, lacrosse and programming. My favorite design creation, A Well Designed Pocket Consitution, was a combination of a love of design and an interest in constitutional law.
<br/>
I think my interest in the concept of "and" started very early. My parents always encouraged me to pursue whatever I was interested in, and to combine with other interests. My high school also put a great emphasis on interdisciplinary learning, and I found great satisfaction in combining different subjects.
<br />
In the end, it really isn't that deep. Yet, I feel the ampersand is a great summation of my ethos - both creatively and as a person.
