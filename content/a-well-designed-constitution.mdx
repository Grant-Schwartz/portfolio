> “The society we have described can never grow into a reality or see the light of day, and there will be no end to the troubles of states, or indeed, my dear Glaucon, of humanity itself, till philosophers become rulers in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers, and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands.” <br /><br/> - Plato, The Republic

## The Story

I was sitting around early one morning shortly after the overturning of Row, and thought to myself, "Why don't I own a physical constitution?" It seems like a civically active thing to have afterall. Then it hit me, they're ugly!
<br />
Why would I ever want to put an ugly book on my bookshelf or coffee table. Most of the pocket constitutions out there **look like they were made in 1787**. So, I decided to make modern one. In the spirit of the document, all files have been made available for free, and can be downloaded on this very page. They're great to view digitally, but are even better as a booklet.
